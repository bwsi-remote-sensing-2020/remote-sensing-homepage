      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>

      <description>The Remote Sensing course uses Python and Data Science to improve natural disaster relief and recovery.
Throughout the course, students learn to use the Geographic Information System, GIS, to analyze buildings, roads, and networks. When combined with machine learning classification and processing algorithms, students eventually learn how to optimize natural disaster relief and recovery.

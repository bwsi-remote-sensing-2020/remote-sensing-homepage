<h1>Joining Calls</h1>

<h2 id="about-daily-calls">About Daily Calls</h2>
<p>On weekdays during the program, the class will meet via Zoom at <a href="">https://mit.zoom.us/j/99836688909</a>. You will need to use the Zoom password we provide you, and your MIT email address will be required for joining the call.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although the class officially starts at 10 AM ET, please join the call at 9:45 AM ET before class starts</li>
<li>Calls will start at 9:45 AM ET and end at 06:00 PM ET, with a few breaks (see schedule)</li>
<li>If you have any questions about the course or zoom calls, reach out via the Discord server or email</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="student-program-details">Student Program Details</h2>
<p>This page provides information for participants of the MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) Program.  Please use this document as a reference.</p>
<p>Any questions should be directed to program staff in person or via email at <a href="mailto:bwsi-admin@mit.edu">bwsi-admin@mit.edu</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of an urgent matter, call program staff at 617-444-9381.  This number will not be monitored until July 6, 2020.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-program-expectations">Virtual Program Expectations:</h3>
<p>All students are required to be in the virtual program with video and sound daily.  If a student does not show up with their video enabled and does not enable it upon request from instructors they will be asked to leave the program.  Parents will be notified if a student is not following the rules of the program.</p>
<h3 id="tardyabsence-policy">Tardy/Absence Policy</h3>
<p>If you will be late, you must contact the MIT BWSI Program Manager at <a href="mailto:bwsi-admin@mit.edu">bwsi-admin@mit.edu</a> or call (617) 444-9381 as soon as possible to avoid possible termination from the program.  When calling the telephone number please leave a detailed message including your name and telephone number.  This number should be used for calling in late, absent or for emergencies only.  This number will not be monitored until the start of the program.
Unexcused tardiness or absence from class will result in immediate termination, we will notify parents immediately if a child is asked to leave the program.
If a student is sick, or for some reason feels like they cannot make it to class or a scheduled event, they will be required to contact the MIT BWSI Program Manager at <a href="mailto:bwsi-admin@mit.edu">bwsi-admin@mit.edu</a> or call (617) 444-9381 as soon as possible to avoid possible termination from the program</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>Students may find this program to be more challenging than high school.  Students spend about many hours per day in classes and other mandatory activities.  Students should expect to spend an average of two to three hours per day doing homework.</p>
<p>The first day of class is Monday July 6th, 2020 at 10AM. Classes and seminars are scheduled Monday to Friday, 10AM â€“ 6PM.  All students are expected to be in their virtual classroom by 9:55AM each day ready to work.
You will receive a packet at the program orientation on the first day of class which will contain the daily schedule, class syllabus, and other important technical program related information.
Unless otherwise indicated on the schedule, this program requires attendance at all program activities, both academic and non-academic.</p>
<h3 id="lunch">Lunch</h3>
<p>Lunchtimes will be dependent on your course schedules and will be listed in your orientation package you receive on the first day.  At this time you can break from the virtual session but are required to be back in the session 5 minutes before end of the break.</p>
<h3 id="attire">Attire</h3>
<p>All classes and other program events are casual attire and we are asking that students are respectful of other students in this virtual environment and dress appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="laptop-computer-and-class-supplies">Laptop Computer and Class Supplies</h3>
<p>Like the online course, students will must provide their own laptop computer for use in the program, and for homework.  Some courses will be sending hardware kits to students as part of the curriculum.  Due to the accelerated nature of BWSI, it is very important that care is taken with the materials sent, as there may not be time to replace broken or lost parts before the end of the course.
As a participant in BWSI, you will be provided an MIT email (aka Kerberos ID), this is so that you can authenticate for mit.zoom.us meetings.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to ask program staff if you have any questions.  Your safety is paramount, so please ask first!  Thank you, The BWSI 2020 Program Staff</p>

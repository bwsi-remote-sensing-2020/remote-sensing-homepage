Hugo is an open-source project and lives by the work of its contributors. There are plenty of open issues, and we need your help to make Hugo even more awesome. You don't need to be a Go guru to contribute to the project's development.

## Assumptions

This contribution guide takes a step-by-step approach in hopes of helping newcomers. Therefore, we only assume the following:

* You are new to Git or open-source projects in general
* You are a fan of Hugo and enthusiastic about contributing to the project

## Install Go

The installation of Go should take only a few minutes. You have more than one option to get Go up and running on your machine.

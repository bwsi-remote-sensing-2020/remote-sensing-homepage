## General Information
Beaver Works Summer Institute Remote Sensing program will offer students the opportunity to explore the exciting intersection of data science and disaster response.  The program consists of two components: (1) online course from January to May 2020, open to all interested and committed students; and (2) a four-week virtual summer program. During the course, the students will learn to understand the basics of Python, Git, GIS, machine learning, and image processing through a series of online teaching modules. Students will explore real world datasets featuring disaster imagery from both satellites and aerial platforms. Students in this course will develop experience in an area of data science that is poised to play a critical role in understanding our world.
